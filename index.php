                        "FLY-Mâ€™s Alumni Association has been an incredible support
                        system as I transitioned from student life into the professional
                        world. The fellowship provides not only spiritual encouragement
                        but also guidance on how to integrate faith into my career and
                        relationships. The seminars and networking events help me stay
                        grounded in Christ while navigating the complexities of work,
                        family, and society. Being part of this community reminds me
                        that no matter how far I go in life, I always have a place where
                        I belongâ€”a place where faith and professional excellence go hand
                        in hand."
