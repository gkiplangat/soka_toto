                  God-ordained mission. Let us walk together, uplifting our

                  <p>FLY-M was founded in 1987 by Presbyter Kato, who initially received invitations to conduct pastoral programs in primary schools, starting with Moi Avenue Primary School in Nairobi.</p>

                  <p>Breach Repairers (BR) was founded in 2005 with the vision of promoting balanced living and addressing the challenges faced by students transitioning from high school to higher institutions of learning, such as newfound freedom and academic pressure. The club focuses on love, worship, intercession, and outreach, offering workshops, mentorship programs, and counseling to add value and foster excellence in students' lives. </p>

                  <p>FLY-M Junior Radicals (JR) was created in June 2017 as a WhatsApp group aimed at keeping students engaged during school holidays and after the KCSE exams. This initiative became especially important during the Covid-19 lockdown when schools across Kenya closed indefinitely. The prolonged closure posed unique challenges: parents weren’t accustomed to having students home for extended periods, and many students struggled with isolation, boredom, and negative influences such as crime, immorality, and addictions.
